# Reccurrence Histogram Builder

![LogisticBifurcation](bifurcation.png)

This repository contains MATLAB files to generate histograms and visualizations of state visitations determined by 1d reccurrence relationships such as the logistic map. For more information on reccurrence relations and dynamic chaos check out this [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk).

# Usage

The core function to generate the reccurrence map histograms is map_counts.m. bifurcation_image.m is an example file for rendering the bifurcation image (shown above) given the logistic map reccurrence relationship (logistic_map.m).
